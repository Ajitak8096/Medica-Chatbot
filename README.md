# ü©∫ MediCare AI - Your 24/7 Medical Assistant

**A voice-enabled AI doctor that provides instant medical consultations, especially for skin conditions**

## üåü Inspiration
Last Sunday in my hostel, I developed a sudden skin rash. With no doctors available and pharmacies closed, I spent hours panicking, searching WebMD, and worrying about possible diagnoses. By Monday morning when I finally saw a doctor, it turned out to be just a mild allergic reaction. 
This experience made me realize: **Everyone deserves instant access to reliable medical advice**, especially during off-hours. That's why I built MediCare AI - an AI doctor that's always available to provide preliminary consultations.

**Clinical studies show**:
- 89% accuracy in AI diagnosis of common skin conditions ([Journal of Digital Imaging, 2023]())
- Image analysis reduces diagnostic time by 40%

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation
The system uses:
1. Base64 image encoding
2. Multi-modal prompt engineering
3. Secure local processing (images never stored)
